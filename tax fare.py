# In a particular jurisdiction, taxi fares consist of a base fare of $4.00, plus $0.25
# for every 140 meters traveled. Write a function that takes the distance traveled (in
# kilometers) as its only parameter and returns the total fare as its only result. Write a
# main program that demonstrates the function.
# Hint: Taxi fares change over time. Use constants to represent the base fare and
# the variable portion of the fare so that the program can be updated easily when
# the rates increase
